pseudocode
for each token in the postfix expression:
  if token is an operator:
    operand_2 ← pop from the stack
    operand_1 ← pop from the stack
    result ← evaluate token with operand_1 and operand_2
    push result back onto the stack
  else if token is an operand:
    push token onto the stack
result ← pop from the stack
